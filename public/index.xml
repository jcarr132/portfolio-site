      <description>by Joshua Carr This post describes a study that I completed as a part of my HCI Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis at Carleton University. This was a qualitative interview study which was aimed at understanding factors related to acceptance and adoption of brain-computer interface (BCI) devices by the public. This project was originally published as Chapter 4 of my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, available here.
