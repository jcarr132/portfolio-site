## Introduction

I earned my Master's in Human-Computer Interaction from Carleton University in
September 2020.  My thesis, titled "Evaluating the Usability of Passthought
Authentication", was about the application of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
to the problem of authentication. Briefly, the text-based passwords that most
of us are familiar with exhibit a number of usability problems which lead to
behaviours that compromise security, such as reusing the same passwords
multiple times or writing them down. Researchers have been proposing new types
of authentication mechanisms for years, but so far nothing has really stuck and
passwords stubbornly remain as the *de facto* standard for authentication
across nearly all domains.

The idea of using BCIs for authentication is not new, and was first suggested
in 2005 by another Carleton graduate student, Dr. Julie Thorpe (now of Ontario
Tech University). Since then, a rather significant body of work has been built
up around the topic of *"passthoughts"*, with some studies reporting
authentication accuracies well above 90%.  Passthoughts demonstrate some
desirable characteristics for strong security; however, the critical question of
their usability has been mostly overlooked. With my thesis project, I aimed to
comprehensively evaluate the usability of BCI-based authentication systems
using a variety of methods, and to identify the main barriers to their
acceptance and adoption.
