### Introduction


I earned my Master's in Human-Computer Interaction from Carleton University in
September 2020.  My thesis, titled "Evaluating the Usability of Passthought
Authentication", was about the application of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
to the problem of authentication (sometimes called *passthought
authentication*). The project began as an effort to develop a BCI
authentication prototype in order to conduct user testing, but grew into a
broader investigation of the role of BCIs in society and the major barriers to
their acceptance including privacy, security, applicability, and general
uneasiness and uncertainty associated with neurotechnologies. The course of the
project was also largely defined by the global COVID-19 pandemic which required
a move away from in-person user testing to alternative remote methods.

This was a huge project, and I'm hoping for this summary to be pretty concise,
so I will omit many details. For more detail on any of these sections, [the
full-text PDF of my thesis can be downloaded here.](/docs/thesis_FINAL.pdf)


### Objective

The text-based passwords that most of us are familiar with exhibit a number of
usability problems which lead to user behaviours that compromise security, such
as reusing the same passwords multiple times or writing them down. This is
compounded by the fact that people are maintaining a greater number of online
accounts than ever before. Researchers have been proposing new types of
authentication mechanisms for years, but so far nothing has really stuck and
passwords stubbornly remain as the *de facto* standard for authentication
across nearly all domains.

The idea of using BCIs for authentication is not new, and was first suggested
in 2005 by another Carleton graduate student, Dr. Julie Thorpe (now of Ontario
Tech University). Since then, a rather significant body of work has been built
up around the topic of *"passthoughts"*, with some studies reporting
authentication accuracies well above 90%.  Passthoughts demonstrate some
desirable characteristics for strong security; however, the critical question
of their usability has been mostly overlooked. At the same time, a new
generation of direct-to-consumer BCI devices have emerged in recent years which
claim they are going to bring BCIs to the mainstream. With my thesis project, I
aimed to comprehensively evaluate the usability of BCI-based authentication
systems using a variety of methods, and to identify the main barriers to their
acceptance and adoption.
