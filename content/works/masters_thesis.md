## Introduction

[The full-text PDF of my thesis can be downloaded here.](/docs/thesis_FINAL.pdf)

I earned my Master's in Human-Computer Interaction from Carleton University in
September 2020.  My thesis, titled "Evaluating the Usability of Passthought
Authentication", was about the application of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
to the problem of authentication. Briefly, the text-based passwords that most
of us are familiar with exhibit a number of usability problems which lead to
behaviours that compromise security, such as reusing the same passwords
multiple times or writing them down. Researchers have been proposing new types
of authentication mechanisms for years, but so far nothing has really stuck and
passwords stubbornly remain as the *de facto* standard for authentication
across nearly all domains.

The idea of using BCIs for authentication is not new, and was first suggested
in 2005 by another Carleton graduate student, Dr. Julie Thorpe (now of Ontario
Tech University). Since then, a rather significant body of work has been built
up around the topic of *"passthoughts"*, with some studies reporting
authentication accuracies well above 90%.  Passthoughts demonstrate some
desirable characteristics for strong security; however, the critical question of
their usability has been mostly overlooked. With my thesis project, I aimed to
comprehensively evaluate the usability of BCI-based authentication systems
using a variety of methods, and to identify the main barriers to their
acceptance and adoption.

The first step in the project was building a BCI authentication application
that could be used to conduct usability testing. I designed and implemented a
basic prototype using an Emotiv BCI headset, described in the next section, but
unfortunately this part of the project was put on hold prior to the beginning
of real user testing due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and
associated suspension of in-person research activities at Carleton. Without the
ability to meet in-person with study participants and have them use the BCI
authentication system, no further progress was possible on this part of the
project.

In order to still complete my thesis on time, I changed the design of the
project to include two remote studies. The first was a qualitative
semi-structured interview study with BCI experts who I recruited via online
forums and and cold emails, and the second was a quantitative survey of workers
from Amazon Mechanical Turk (an online crowdsourcing platform for human
intelligence tasks) with no prior experience using BCIs. Both studies were
intended to identify barriers associated with the acceptance and willingness
for people to adopt passthought authentication.
