This post describes a study that I completed as a part of my Master's thesis at
Carleton University. This was a qualitative interview study which was aimed at
understanding factors related to acceptance and adoption of brain-computer
interface (BCI) devices by the public.

## Organization

* Carleton University - Human-Oriented Technology Software Research Lab
  [(HotSoft)](https://hotsoft.carleton.ca/hotsoft/)
* Supervised by [Dr. Robert Biddle](https://carleton.ca/scs/people/robert-biddle/)

## Project Timeline

Interviews were conducted between February 1 and April 9 of 2020. The interview
data were transcribed and analyzed over the following months before the project
was concluded with my thesis defense on September 13, 2020.

## My Role

I was the lead researcher on this project, in collaboration with my thesis
supervisor Dr. Biddle who provided advice and guidance throughout the process.
I was responsible for preparing the Research Ethics Board (REB) proposal,
recruiting participants, conducting remote interviews, transcribing, analyzing,
and interpreting the data, and communicating the results.

## Project Summary

I recruited a sample of experienced brain-computer interface (BCI) users and
researchers and conducted semi-structured interviews with them as part of a
larger research agenda to understand public acceptance and adoption of
commercial BCI devices. Interviews were conducted remotely due to COVID-19
restrictions and owing to the fact that experienced BCI users are difficult to
find. I analyzed and interpreted the data according to [Reflexive Thematic
Analysis](https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/thematic-analysis.html#95c4b0bee0b9774eee5f7ba22cb91d53),
a bottom-up approach for deriving general themes from unstructured text data.

Using this approach, I discovered that BCI experts believe that there are
several barriers to the public acceptance and adoption of BCIs. They identified
uncertainty about the security and privacy of BCIs, high difficulty involved in
using them, and a need for further development as the most major areas of
concern. These findings provide a possible roadmap of issues to be addressed in
order to promote the adoption of BCIs among the general population.

## Context

Neuralink brought BCIs into public focus in 2020 when they demonstrated their
state-of-the-art BCI system, described by Elon Musk as *"a Fitbit in your skull
with tiny wires"*, which had been implanted into the brain of a healthy pig.
This technology has the potential to radically improve the lives of people living
with severe disabilities such as blindness or paralysis, but the days of
healthy people voluntarily receiving brain implants are probably still far off.

On the other hand, over the past decade a number of companies have released
direct-to-consumer BCI headsets which allow regular people to interact with a
computer system using their brain activity via safe, noninvasive sensors placed
at the surface of the scalp. However, so far none of these devices has achieved
significant adoption outside of researchers or enthusiast communities despite
being available for the better part of a decade. Why is that?  What are the
most significant barriers preventing their adoption by the wider public?  Is
there a real future for these devices, or are they just a novelty? These are
the questions that motivated me to conduct this interview study.

A major difficulty in studying people's attitudes toward BCI devices stems from
the fact that very few people know much about them, and the general public tend
to be uninformed or misinformed about BCIs, how they work, and the extent of
their capabilities. For this reason, I decided to sidestep this issue
completely by focusing my efforts on people who already have significant
hands-on experience with BCIs. This means that the resulting sample would be
smaller, but I could be sure that the interviewees would be well-informed about
the topics that I wanted to investigate. In another study, I took what I
learned from these interviews to conduct an online survey gathering opinions
about BCIs from people who had never used one before.


## The Study

I recruited interviewees using social media posts to BCI-related online
communities as well as directly emailing several researchers who I identified
by surveying the academic literature. In total, seven people agreed to be
interviewed. Seven is a small sample, but it was within my expectations given
that BCIs are not common, and it is also typical for qualitative studies
involving unstructured data to have relatively small samples (i.e., *n* < 10).

The interviews were conducted remotely using commercial videoconferencing
software (Zoom, Skype, etc.) and recorded locally. Afterward, I went through each
recording and transcribed all of the meaningful quotes from the interview.

The process of Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) involves assigning one or more
*codes* to each piece of text. Codes are short descriptions that capture a
particular element of the text. For example, take the following quote:

<blockquote>
P3: "What really concerns me is that there could be sources of bias that slip
into the signal that we don't know about, gender or racial biases. I don't
think anyone knows."
</blockquote>

This quote was assigned the following codes:
<ul>
<li>Perceived sensitivity of BCI data.</li>
<li>Data aggregation.</li>
<li>Lack of knowledge to fully understand BCI implications.</li>
</ul>

Next, the codes are arranged and grouped according to their content in order to
form themes. A theme is a single central concept that organizes and
contextualizes a set of codes in relation to the research question. For
example, the first two codes from the preceding list (*Perceived sensitivity of
BCI data* and *Data aggregation*) were grouped with other codes related to data
collection for form the *Data Privacy* theme. In total, I generated eight
themes, which I then grouped into three *meta-themes*, discussed in the
following section.

## Results

Here I will describe the meta-themes that were identified, along with
the associated themes and codes for each.

#### Meta-theme: Perceived Safety of BCIs

The first and most significant meta-theme was that of *Safety*, with the
subthemes of *Data Privacy*, *Surveillance*, and *Consumer Protection*.
Specifically, potential users worry that using a BCI might put them at risk in
some way such as compromising their private information or facilitating a cyber
attack.  Compounding this is the belief that average consumers don't possess
the necessary knowledge to make informed choices about BCI use, and current
privacy legislation fails to adequately protect user data from non-medical
BCIs.

Importantly, participants stressed that what matters is whether BCIs are
*perceived* as safe and secure, irrespective of whether they actually are. A
number of common concerns, such as entities being able to *read* the thoughts
of the user, are not really feasible given the current state of the technology,
but the fact that people believe them to be possible is nonetheless a
significant barrier for their acceptance and comfort.

|                     | - BCI-based cyber attacks.                        |
|                     | - Unaware of privacy policy.                      |
| Surveillance        | - BCIs for mental surveillance.                   |
|                     | - Abuse by corporations, governments.             |
|                     | - Advanced military BCIs.                         |
| Consumer Protection | - Average consumer can't make informed decision.  |
|                     | - Incorrect beliefs/expectations of BCIs.         |
|                     | - Researchers have lower expectations.            |
|                     | - People think you can read thoughts with EEG.    |
|                     | - BCI comfort requires strong privacy protection. |
|                     | - The capabilities of BCIs are overstated.        |
|                     | - BCI manufacturers restrict user access to data. |

#### Meta-theme: Usability of BCIs

The next meta-theme was *Usability*, which includes the *Difficulty* involved
in setting up and using a BCI as well as factors relating to the physical
and psychosocial *Comfort* of wearing BCI devices for long periods or in the
presence of other people.

{{< table >}}
| Theme      | Code                                        |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Difficulty | - BCI hardware is difficult to use.         |
|            | - BCI software is difficult to use.         |
|            | - Usability-performance trade-off.          |
|            | - Ease-of-setup important for BCI devices.  |
| Comfort    | - Devices become comfortable over time.     |
|            | - User can become habituated to the device. |
|            | - Social stigma/aesthetics of BCIs.         |
|            | - *"Creepiness"*.                           |
{{</ table >}}


#### Meta-theme: Development of BCIs

The final meta-theme is the need for further *Development* of BCI technologies.
The interviewees suggested that we are only in the very early stages of BCI
development, and that BCIs will become common at some point in the *Future*. It
was commonly pointed out that there aren't really any compelling real-world
*Applications* to justify using BCIs, and even in cases where they could be
used, there's usually a much easier way that has already been figured out.

<blockquote>
P5: "The consistent result is that people think [the BCI] is really cool for
ten minutes, then ask for the mouse and keyboard back, take the BCI off, and
never put it on again."
</blockquote>

Further research and development in the field of BCI will hopefully also
improve the *Performance* characteristics of these devices, such as the
signal-to-noise ratio of their sensors, which will help to expand their
capabilities further.

| Theme        | Code                                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Applications | - BCIs need a compelling primary use-case.                     |
|              | - BCIs have value, serve a purpose.                            |
|              | - Meditation/neurofeedback training.                           |
|              | - BCIs are a novelty.                                          |
|              | - Other interactions methods are better for most people.       |
| Future       | - Early stages of BCI development.                             |
|              | - BCIs will probably be common in the future.                  |
|              | - BCIs aren't powerful now but will be one day.                |
|              | - Privacy and security issues should be addressed proactively. |
|              | - Lack of general understanding about neurological data.       |
| Performance  | - Disappointed in performance of BCIs.                         |
|              | - Low bitrate.                                                 |
|              | - Non-stationarity of EEG.                                     |
|              | - Ambient electrical interference.                             |
|              | - EEG data quality is low.                                     |
|              | - Invasive BCIs more impressive than non-invasive.             |
|              | - Commercial BCIs are well-designed.                           |

## Reflection

Throughout this process I was able to develop a comprehensive understanding of
the most significant barriers preventing the acceptance and adoption of BCIs
among the general public. These findings provide a potential roadmap for BCI
developers to address by improving the perceived safety, usability, and
applicability of BCIs.

I was able to learn a great deal and develop my research skills during this
study.  This was the first time that I've conducted a purely qualitative
research project, and I was able to practice conducting interviews as well as
working with unstructured qualitative data. This study would likely have been
conducted remotely even if not for COVID-19 because the participants were
geographically sparse, but the experience of conducting user research remotely
is extremely valuable as it seems like this will be the norm for the
foreseeable future.
