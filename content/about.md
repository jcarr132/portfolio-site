I'm a researcher and data analyst specializing in human-factors in computing.
I have a multidisciplinary background which includes experience in molecular
neurobiology, cognitive science, software development, quantitative and
qualitative data analysis, machine learning, and healthcare.

This site is intended as a showcase and repository of my work.
