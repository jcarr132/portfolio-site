I'm a researcher and data analyst specializing in human-factors in computing.
I have a multi-disciplinary background which includes experience in molecular
neurobiology, cognitive science, software development, quantitative and
qualitative data analysis, machine learning, and healthcare. I earned the
degrees of *Bachelor of Science in Psychology* from Trent University in 2015
and *Master of Applied Science in Human-Computer Interaction* from Carleton
University in 2020.

This site is intended as a showcase and repository of my work.
