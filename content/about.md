I'm a user experience (UX) researcher and software developer
specializing in human factors in technology.

I have a multi-disciplinary background that includes user experience,
cognitive science, software development, quantitative and qualitative
analysis, and Agile workflows. I earned the degrees of *Bachelor of
Science in Psychology* from Trent University in 2015 and *Master of
Applied Science in Human-Computer Interaction* from Carleton University
in 2020.

I am primarily interested in understanding the complex and evolving
relationship between people and our technology; how we create and shape
technology which in turn shapes us as individuals and as a global
society. I believe in technology as a tool of empowerment and that
should contribute to the betterment of life for all people.

Some topics I'm currently interested in:
- Human factors in software development
- Veganism and animal rights
- Open-Source Software/Free Software Movement
- Technology and mental health
- Social Justice, LGBTQ+/GSRM issues
- Digital minimalism
- Right to repair
- Programming languages
- Game design and development
- Cooking

This site is intended as a showcase and repository of my work.
